Initial Analysis
1.   Quebec has the top 5 NDVI values in both large and small population areas throughout the years
2.   Alberta and Manitoba have shared the positions for lowest NDVI over the years
Trend Analysis
*   Small population areas in Quebec shown to have healthier and denser vegetation throughout the years.
*   Small population areas in Ontario have similar but slightly lower density of vegetation than Quebec, overtaking them for some period of time
*   Manitoba and Alberta have the lowest density of vegetation throughout the years
*   overall from 2000 to 2023 the vegetation has seen a decline in all provinces
Comparison between small and large population areas
*   Small population areas tend to have healthier and denser vegetation. 
*   This is because in urban areas due to higher population density, there is more vegetation area cleared for construction of roads, houses and other buildings. 
Comparison analysis over the years
1.   The trend lines for small and large population throughout the years intersect between 0.55 and 0.65 ndvi most of the time
2.   In the year 2018 there was a high number of small population areas that had just over 0.45 NDVI
3.   In the year 2023 a high number of large population areas had over 0.65 NDVI
TIME SERIES ANALYSIS FOR ONTARIO

NDVI is predicted to gradually decrease while spiking in certain years in large population areas in Ontario by 2034 to 2036. All time low of 0.45
